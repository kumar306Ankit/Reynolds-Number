# Reynolds-Number

A simple and affordable experiment to determine the Reynolds number for water flowing through a cylindrical aperture. Commercially available equipment exists but often at high cost. Instead, the use of simple laboratory equipment (stopwatches, measuring cylinders and plastic bottles).

The Reynolds number obtained from this experiment can be used to determine the flow regime of the water. A Reynolds number of less than 2000 indicates laminar flow, while a Reynolds number greater than 4000 indicates turbulent flow. Reynolds numbers between 2000 and 4000 may indicate transitional flow.

Note: It is important to ensure that the hole in the bottle is small enough to ensure laminar flow. If the hole is too large, the flow may become turbulent and the Reynolds number will not accurately reflect the flow regime.
