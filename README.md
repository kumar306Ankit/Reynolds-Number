# Reynolds-Number

This project presents a cost-effective way to determine the Reynolds number for water flow through a cylindrical aperture using simple laboratory equipment, such as stopwatches, measuring cylinders, and plastic bottles. The experiment involves measuring the flow rate and viscosity of water, and the diameter and length of the aperture to calculate the Reynolds number. The results can be compared to theoretical values and commercially available equipment to validate the accuracy of the method. The project aims to provide an accessible and affordable alternative for students and researchers who may not have access to expensive equipment.

Result:
The Reynolds number obtained from this experiment can be used to determine the flow regime of the water. A Reynolds number of less than 2000 indicates laminar flow, while a Reynolds number greater than 4000 indicates turbulent flow. Reynolds numbers between 2000 and 4000 may indicate transitional flow.

Note: It is important to ensure that the hole in the bottle is small enough to ensure laminar flow. If the hole is too large, the flow may become turbulent and the Reynolds number will not accurately reflect the flow regime.
